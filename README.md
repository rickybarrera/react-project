# INTRO

This project accesses your spotify account and allows it to view all of your liked songs and access your playlists in the Library menu. In the Library menu you can click the play button and it will redirect you to the player page and play a preview of the tracks in your playlist. (The spotify api doesn't have preview urls for all songs so not every song will play, also for full access of the site send me your email so I can allow permissions to interact with it.)

Future Icebox features: 
1. I want to be able to navigate from the favorite tracks page to the player page and just play one song.
2. implement a different api to allow the full song to play
3. add pages that feature trending tracks or charts
